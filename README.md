Knut is a new approach to decentralized stable 
assets.  Each vow represents a contractual obligation
to provide a specified amount of knuts in order to 
retrieve the underlying asset.  These vows are 
fully tradable themselves, and can be viewed as unbounded
calls on the underlying asset. 

The stability of a knut relies on opportunistic market makers.  
Since Knut does not enforce a stability fee nor open the door 
for liquidations, users can create vows with the assurance that
their asset can always be retrieved, so long as they have the coins.
